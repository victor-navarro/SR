## Simple MATLAB implementation of an S-R learning model with a similarity kernel

This model uses a similarity kernel to retrieve node-specific associative strength. In this case, the nodes activate "select" or "reject" nodes. 
The model itself is in SR.m. Several tasks have been implemented (see train.m).
